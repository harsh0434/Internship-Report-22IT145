# Earthquake Data Analysis Project

## 📌 Overview

This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Visualization** of earthquake data using **Python** and **Power BI**.
The primary aim is to transform raw seismic records into actionable insights that can aid in disaster preparedness, seismic risk assessment, and long-term planning.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Clean and preprocess earthquake datasets (daily, monthly, yearly).
* Perform **EDA** to uncover patterns in magnitude, depth, and frequency.
* Visualize earthquake distributions and hotspots across regions.
* Build an **interactive Power BI dashboard** for stakeholders.
* Derive insights that can support **decision-making in disaster management**.

---

## 🗂 Dataset

The dataset contains attributes such as:

* Date/Time of earthquake
* Magnitude
* Depth (km)
* Latitude & Longitude (epicenter)
* Region/Place of occurrence

Format: CSV (Comma-Separated Values)

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

* **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) → Data cleaning, EDA, correlation analysis
* **Power BI** → Dashboard creation & interactive visualizations
* **MS Excel** → Initial data checks & formatting

---

## 📊 Methodology

1. **Data Collection** – Gather earthquake datasets (daily, monthly, yearly).
2. **Preprocessing** – Handle missing values, clean column names, format dates.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis** –

   * Frequency trend analysis (daily, monthly, yearly)
   * Magnitude and depth distributions
   * Correlation heatmaps between features
   * Epicenter mapping
4. **Visualization** – Create plots using Python and dashboards in Power BI.
5. **Insights & Reporting** – Document findings, create visuals, and prepare final report.

---

## 📈 Results & Insights

* Identified **time-based spikes** in earthquake frequency.
* Most earthquakes were **shallow in depth**, but high-magnitude quakes—though rare—were highly impactful.
* Epicenter analysis confirmed seismic hotspots aligned with tectonic fault lines.
* Correlation analysis showed strong ties between magnitude and energy release, but weak relation with depth.

## 📌 Deliverables

* **Python Notebook** (`.ipynb`) – Data preprocessing, EDA, visualizations
* **Power BI Dashboard** (`.pbix`) – Interactive analysis & exploration
* **Final Project Report** (`.docx/.pdf`) – Methodology, findings, recommendations

---

## 🚀 Future Scope

* Apply **predictive models** (time-series forecasting) for earthquake trend prediction.
* Integrate **real-time dashboards** for live monitoring.
* Perform **geospatial analysis** using GIS tools.
* Extend analysis to multi-year datasets for deeper insights.
